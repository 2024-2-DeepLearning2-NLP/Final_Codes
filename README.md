# Final Codes
This is our final codes for **"Towards Understanding Omission in Dialogue Summarization"**

We didn't include dataset in this repository

(I separated them because they might not fit into a single repository due to the size.)

→ preprocessed_dataset repository: <https://github.com/2024-2-DeepLearning2-NLP/Preprocessed_Datasets>





## in process
#### 1. main_"dataset".sh →→ we train our model and build omission dataset.
#### 2. process.sh →→ we group omission datasets built at step 1, and build omission labels 
#### 3.
